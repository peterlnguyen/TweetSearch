1. need to optimize deeply nested callback: http://andrewkelley.me/post/js-callback-organization.html
2. think about decoupling the twitter extraction, indexing, and retrieving, because the only time those three actions are combined is when
    the user searches for the screen name, which should be an edge case.
3. possibly limit to the latest 200 tweets?  be sure to modularize to prepare for future extension.
  - or fetch first 200 and the continue fetching in the background? or with a cron job?
