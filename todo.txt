- fetch first 200 and the continue fetching in the background? or with a cron job?

- sanitize input
- need to modularize routing
- need to parse and print useful error messages (handle doesn't exist, no results, etc)
- set match tweet limits to 200
- classes and inheritance to remove all of the referencing "var logger = ..." clutter in tests, especially, but also in controller and other classes.

- maybe helper class for mainController
