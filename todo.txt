- possibly limit to the latest 200 tweets?  be sure to modularize to prepare for future extension.
  - or fetch first 200 and the continue fetching in the background? or with a cron job?
- still need to unit test index_bulk_tweet, especially since it's involved in a nested function.  on other hand, nested function is an edge case.
- need to separate twitter API keys


*** bottom two errors could be due to twitter api max limit
- make clean destroys "tweet" index so that *nothing* exists, is especially apparent when you clean and then call get_and_index_timeline
  - somehow create a setup file
- need to only destroy mattcutts in test_api
- helper class for elascticModel and maybe mainController
