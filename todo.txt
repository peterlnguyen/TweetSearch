- possibly limit to the latest 200 tweets?  be sure to modularize to prepare for future extension.
  - or fetch first 200 and the continue fetching in the background? or with a cron job?
- parse twitter json for invalid screen name
- sanitize input
- need to pass in fixed screen_names to all views that have text-search


*** bottom two errors could be due to twitter api max limit
- make clean destroys "tweet" index so that *nothing* exists, is especially apparent when you clean and then call get_and_index_timeline
  - somehow create a setup file
- need to only destroy mattcutts in test_api
- maybe helper class for mainController
