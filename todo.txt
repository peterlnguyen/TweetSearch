- possibly limit to the latest 200 tweets?  be sure to modularize to prepare for future extension.
  - or fetch first 200 and the continue fetching in the background? or with a cron job?

- parse twitter json for invalid screen name
- sanitize input
- need to modularize routing
- need to parse and print useful error messages (handle doesn't exist, no results, etc)


*** bottom two errors could be due to twitter api max limit
- make clean destroys "tweet" index so that *nothing* exists, is especially apparent when you clean and then call get_and_index_timeline
  - somehow create a setup file
- maybe helper class for mainController
